# GitHub Setup Guide - First Commit

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `upmysalary-resume-optimizer`
5. Description: `AI-powered resume optimization web application using OpenAI GPT-4`
6. Set to Private (recommended for business projects)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Open the Shell/Terminal in Replit and run these commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/upmysalary-resume-optimizer.git

# Check current status
git status

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create .gitignore if needed
echo "node_modules/
.env
.env.local
dist/
*.log
.DS_Store
.vscode/
*.zip
*.pdf
*.docx
*.txt
attached_assets/*.pdf
attached_assets/*.docx
attached_assets/*.txt" > .gitignore

# Add .gitignore
git add .gitignore

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: UpMySalary Resume Optimizer

- React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all project files uploaded
3. The README.md will display automatically on the repository homepage

## Next Steps After First Commit

1. **Set up GitHub Pages** (optional) for project documentation
2. **Configure branch protection** for main branch
3. **Add collaborators** if working with a team
4. **Set up GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (future enhancement)

## Environment Variables for Deployment

Remember to configure these in your deployment environment:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`

## Security Notes

- The `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files (`.env`, credentials)
- Sample resumes in `attached_assets/` are excluded from version control
- All API keys should be stored as environment variables, never in code

Your project is now ready for version control and collaboration!
